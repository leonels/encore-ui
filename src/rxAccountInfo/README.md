Functionality for populating an `rxInfoBox` with a user's account details.

This functionality is very specific to internal Rackspace needs, but also lives as a demonstration on how to make
use of the `rxInfoBox`.

This directive requires that `SupportAccount` and `Encore` services are available. These are not provided by this project,
but are available in an internal Rackspace repository.
